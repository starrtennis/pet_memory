Pet Memorial / MyPet / PetMemo: website/webapp
+ people (users) post about their pet
the pet has a profile
people love teir pets so will drive traffic

no pet profile equals easier
just post ad hoc

design method for ad hoc posting

no account

use django data storage methods

+ combine best componenets of pet memorial and mypet, easier and more efficient to code [?]

design before code

figma?
or just paper and pencil

---.gitignore file contains entry for virtual environments (good!)---

efficiency gains in code noticed but not identified specifically

first pass thru dev branch, c.s. made substantial improvements

held out on migration and migration application until local local personal branch split from dev tree

static compress / static_compress? (biomedical engineering? systems engineering?)
+ figure out redis
improve appearances, but only if genuine concern (sophisticated requisition)
^^^always improve appearances[?], whether concerned or not^^^

let's migrate! (and apply migrations)

migrations applied

were already staged

updated YES to DEBUG MODE ON (was inappropriate)
	(located in project urls.py file)
	
home extends base (comp sci thank you)

home view references home.html located in project templates folder
has context dictionary correctly updated (double check arrays/lists) but
does not display any content
checking models
pet owner and pet photo models reference  "custom user manager"
+ ? querying duckduckgo
seems to be planning for future progress on project authentication features & functions
functions and features?
whatever... <<<

classified as backend coding

django is full stack?

handling object permissions "" ?
+ auth forms (what of them?)
+ custom users (&& django.contrib.admin)
persimmons for gibbons
further developments of models.py
fewer system errors in locating /home AFTER applying migrations (phew)
would like to eliminate completely to look at picture of happy man w/happy dog w/bold section header text style and appealing to eye minimal design {thumbs up to c.s.}
ergonomics (look into it--not just buying stuff)
simple principles (to follow (like an idiot))
redis (look into further when eyes don't hurt)
per-site cache
	underutilized stack overflow entry (don't be one of them)
	
+ to prevent secret key leak, figure out how to store constant variable in separate file, and then how to reference it (some duckduckgo may be required)
+ update version of pip
+ install memcached (?)

user nodes
permission nodes

pass-thru applications

		Possible to have no owner profile. Only pet. Keep app pet-centric.
		(Requires remodeling).
		
		Es posible no tener perfil de propietario. Solo mascota.
		Mantén la aplicación centrada en las mascotas.
		(Requiere remodelación).
		
		Name: Pet Memory (already in logo)
		rename app? (to Pet Memory) in github and files is correct/incorrect?
